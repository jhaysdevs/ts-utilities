# Common TypeScript Utilities

So this repository is basically my first efforts to start slowly converting my JavaScript tendencies into TypeScript, by way of recreating all of my JavaScript utilities into TypeScript utilities one by one, whilst making sure they're usable within my current JavaScript projects (in hopes to create seamless drop-in replacements).

## Updates

Currently each utility is aptly named to describe its intended purpose. Check back here periodically for more updates.
